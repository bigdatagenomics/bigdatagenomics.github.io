### RNAdam: An RNA pipeline built on top of ADAM

RNAdam is a toolkit for processing RNA-seq data through the [ADAM API](/projects/adam).
We are in the process of building a scalable pipeline to implement both fusion transcript
calling, as well as calculating transcript abundance.

RNAdam is on [Github](https://github.com/bigdatagenomics/RNAdam), and is in active development.
