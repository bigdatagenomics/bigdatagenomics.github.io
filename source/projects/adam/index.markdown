### ADAM: Data Alignment/Map

ADAM provides both an application programming interface (API) and a command line interface (CLI)
for manipulating genomic data on a computing cluster. ADAM operates on data stored inside of
[Parquet](http://www.parquet.io) with the [bdg-formats](/projects/bdg-formats/) schemas,
using [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/), and provides scalable performance on clusters
larger than 100 machines.

ADAM is on [Github](https://github.com/bigdatagenomics/adam). Quick start guides are available
for [running ADAM on EC2](https://github.com/bigdatagenomics/adam/wiki/Running-ADAM-on-EC2), and
for [building ADAM for specific CDH releases](https://github.com/bigdatagenomics/adam/wiki/Running-ADAM-on-CDH-4-or-5).

### Releases

The latest available release of ADAM is 0.6.1. ADAM is available for projects using Maven or SBT
through the [Sonatype OSS repository](https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository).

### Support

For support using ADAM, please contact the [ADAM developer mailing list](/mail/). Additionally, we
track issues and feature enhancement requests through our
[Github issue tracker](https://github.com/bigdatagenomics/adam/issues).
