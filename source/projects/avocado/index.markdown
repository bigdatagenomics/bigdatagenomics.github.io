### avocado: A Variant Caller, Distributed

avocado is a distributed pipeline for calling variants, and is built on top of [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/)
and the [ADAM API](/projects/adam). avocado provides a highly configurable pipeline that can be
used for the alignment, processing, and variant calling of genomes/exomes/targets. We are currently
in the process of hardening avocado for clincial use, and expanding the avocado pipeline so that it
can triage processing steps based on genomic complexity.

avocado is on [Github](https://github.com/bigdatagenomics/avocado), and is in active development.
