Thanks to advances in both the cost and speed of sequencing technology, the amount of genomic
data available for processing is growing exponentially. As a project, our goal is to build
scalable pipelines for processing genomic data on top of high performance distributed
computing frameworks.

### Projects

At the moment, we are working on three projects:

* [ADAM](/projects/adam/): A scalable API & CLI for genome processing
* [bdg-formats](/projects/bdg-formats): Schemas for genomic data
* [avocado](/projects/avocado/): A Variant Caller, Distributed

The source for these projects is available at [Github](http://www.github.com/bigdatagenomics).
