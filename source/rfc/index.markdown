An RFC is a "Request for Comment" in the same spirit as the [IETF RFC](http://www.ietf.org/rfc.html) but
less formal. There are no requirements on the language and structure of an
RFC; however, the focus should always be on concrete [Avro IDL](http://avro.apache.org/docs/1.7.5/idl.html)
examples to define the data structures with pseudo-code and/or clear descriptions of data transformations and use
cases. Once the team has reached consensus on an RFC, it should be *easy to turn the ideas
into working code* relatively quickly.

All RFCs are open for comment by anyone either via the [ADAM mailing list](/mail) or the comment box in the footer of the
specific RFC.
