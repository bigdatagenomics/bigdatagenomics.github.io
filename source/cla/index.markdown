A [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/cla) is a document that clearly defines the terms under which intellectual property
is being contributed to the Big Data Genomics software projects. A signed CLA needs to be on file before an individual
is allowed to commit rights to any repository in the [bigdatagenomics](https://github.com/bigdatagenomics/) organization.
These agreements are for your protection as a Contributor and do *not* change your rights to use your Contributions
for any other purpose.

There are two CLAs: [individual](/cla/individual/) and [corporate](/cla/corporate/). 

> *Note*: These CLAs are identical to the [individual](http://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt)
> and [corporate](http://www.apache.org/licenses/cla-corporate.txt) agreements used at the [Apache Software Foundation](http://apache.org/) except for changing
> "The Apache Software Foundation" to "The Big Data Genomics Project" and "Foundation" to "BDG Project".

If you are contributing to the [bigdatagenomics](http://github.com/bigdatagenomics/) organization in your free time, you needn't concern yourself
with having a Corporate Contributor License Agreement (CCLA) on file. However, if you are making contributions as
part of your work at a corporation, an authorized person at your corporation will need to [submit a CCLA](/cla/corporate/)
explicitly endorsing your contributions to the [bigdatagenomics](http://github.com/bigdatagenomics/) organization.

Feel free to send an email to `cla at bdgenomics.org` if you have any questions.
